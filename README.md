### Word tetris game is an android application written in java language. You can watch the screen recording taken while using the application from the file named 'ekrankaydÄ±.mp4'. In the game, the difficulty level is selected on the first screen, then meaningful and three-letter words are formed from the flowing letters. Points are earned as much as the letter value. If you enter the wrong word more than three times, penalized letters will appear so that the game ends for the user as the screen fills up. We used the database we created in MongoDB to control the words.
